# Aero Components
Components derive from an aerodynamic component class which implements a RunModel function. RunModel is called by the main AeroBody in runtime for all attached components. The AeroBody then sums the resulting forces and moments for each component and applies them to the attached rigid body.

The current components available in the model are:
- Linear bluff body drag
- Rotational bluff body drag
- Thin aerofoil for lift, centre of pressure motion and induced drag
- Magnus effect for lift generated by rotating bodies
